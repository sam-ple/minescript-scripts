A collection of scripts I’ve created for the Minescript mod, along with various tools, utilities, and examples.

## Note

- I will keep the original repository as a personal memo, but since it is hard to navigate and understand, I’ve created a new repository to reorganize the information.
- Please note that the folder structure and other details are still under consideration and may change.
